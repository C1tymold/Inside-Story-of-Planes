  <h1 id="heading">This photo may seem very stressful but it is as simple as can be!</h1>
  <p id="booboobear">This photo is the evolution of the Boeing 737. As the Boeing 737-100 dominated the skies for 24 years, Airbus joined the skies beginning Boeing's biggest competitor. 
    The a320 (airbus's short-haul aircraft) was magical because it saved money for airliners. Boeing knew that change needed to happen to its dominant b737. They decided to make the Boeing 737-MAX which uses a system that counters the nose drift but unfortunately, 
    one of its first flights Lion Air Flight 610 crashed because shortly after takeoff the nose kept dipping down till crashing into the ocean, there were sadly no survivors</p>
